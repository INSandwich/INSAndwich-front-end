# INSAndwich front-end
In here, we will keep the files regarding the front-end for the INSAndwich project.

The front-end will be built using angular 2, in Typescript. We'll also use material design lite as a CSS framework.

`When you code some front-end, be sure to use the console ;)`

Todo list:
  - Commands !
  - Nice token amount display

Todo, maybe:
  - Localization
  - Password reset link thingy
